The word "server" can mean a lot of things in computing, but we're going to focus on web servers specifically. 
A web server is a process running on a computer that listens for incoming requests for information
over the internet and sends back responses. Each time a user navigates to a website on their browser, 
the browser makes a request to the web server of that website. Every website has at least one web server. 
A large company like Facebook has thousands of powerful computers running web servers in facilities located all around the world 
which are listening for requests, but we could also run a simple web server from our own computer!

The specific format of a request (and the resulting response) is called the protocol. 
You might be familiar with the protocol used to access websites: HTTP. When a visitor navigates to a website on their browser, 
similarly to how one place an order for takeout, they make an HTTP request for the resources that make up that site.

For the simplest websites, a client makes a single request. 
The web server receives that request and sends the client a response containing everything needed to view the website. 
This is called a static website. 
This doesn't mean the website is not interactive. 
As with the individual static assets, a website is static because once those files are received, they don't change or move. 
A static website might be a good choice for a simple personal website with a short bio and family photos. 
A user navigating Twitter, however, wants access to new content as it's created, which a static website couldn't provide.

A static website is like ordering takeout, but modern web applications are like dining in person at a sit-down restaurant. 
A restaurant patron might order drinks, different courses, make substitutions, or ask questions of the waiter. 
To accomplish this level of complexity, an equally complex back-end is required.

The collection of programming logic required to deliver dynamic content to a client, manage security, 
process payments, and myriad other tasks is sometimes known as the "application" or application server. 
The application server can be responsible for anything from sending an email confirmation after a purchase to running 
the complicated algorithms a search engine uses to give us meaningful results.

The back-ends of modern web applications include some sort of database, often more than one. Databases are collections of information. 
There are many different databases, but we can divide them into two types: 
relational databases and non-relational databases (also known as NoSQL databases). 
Whereas relational databases store information in tables with columns and rows, 
non-relational databases might use other systems such as key-value pairs or a document storage model. 
SQL, Structured Query Language, is a programming language for accessing and changing data stored in relational databases.
Popular relational databases include MySQL and PostgreSQL while popular NoSQL databases include MongoDB and Redis.

What is a Relational Database Management System?
A relational database is a type of database. 
It uses a structure that allows us to identify and access data in relation to another piece of data in the database. 
Often, data in a relational database is organized into tables. 

For example, the MEAN stack is a technology stack for building web applications that uses MongoDB, 
Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js: MongoDB is used as the database, Node.js with Express.js for the rest of the back-end, 
and Angular is used as a front-end framework. While the LAMP Stack, sometimes considered the archetypal stack, 
uses Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP.
