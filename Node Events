// Node Js Events module

//import the events module from node
//Beware that EventEmitter is a class
//create a class called MyEmitter and inherit from EventEmitter
//create a new object myEmitter
//myEmitter.on is the same as(myEmitter.addListerner)
//What the .on is doing is listening for an event to emit ! so the question is how is an event emitted ?
//An event is emitted by using the .emit method!
//The most important thing to note is that the name of the event to emit is passed to the .emit as an argument.
//When the .emit is triggred a signal is sent to the .on method which then calls the callback function and logs ('Hey I got called)

const EventEmitter = require('events');
class MyEmitter extends EventEmitter{}


let  myEmitter = new MyEmitter();

myEmitter.on('calling',()=>{
    console.log('Hey I just got called')
});


myEmitter.emit('calling');
