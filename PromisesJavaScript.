//Constructing a Promise Object
//This is How I understand Promisses In JavaScript.

/*
A promise is like doing a house cleaning on a saturday morning.
Whiles You are playing music in the bacground , You are also sweeping the floor and
doing your washing with Your washing machine at the same time.

That is basicall a promise , You don't wait for your washing machine to finish your cloths
before You start cleaning the house , You perform these tasks at the same time !

Promises in Javascript has three states
